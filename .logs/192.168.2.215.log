If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.
         Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
         for more information.

         docker host.

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.
         Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
         for more information.

Swarm initialized: current node (sza7o1kwyk77lzmkxfl5djn4g) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3d4h1d0yqdbtwcy4ueb0a86rrnmz6sr2buumpt8nqrz5ivibhh-0mf30d4zux3oa4o3ua5wqie64 192.168.2.215:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
