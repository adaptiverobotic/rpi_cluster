<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
<p>Here I will describe the layout of the code from a high level perspective.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/code_structure_diagram.png" alt="code structure diagram" /></p>

<p>The application is composed of three layers.</p>

<h3 id="cli">CLI</h3>
<p>A library of shell (bash v4+) scripts that do all of the heavy lifting. This application can be used directly from the command line without the API or GUI. However, the API provides better error handling and filters out potentially bad data. <a href="/pages/cli.html">Learn more…</a></p>

<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<p>A Flask (python 3.6+) REST API wrapper for easier interaction with the CLI. This layer abstracts bash function calls and script executions to HTTP methods such as POST and GET. It also provides an added layer of defense again bad data such as invalid usernames, passwords, and hostnames when establishing common credentials for our servers. <a href="/pages/api.html">Learn more…</a></p>

<h3 id="gui">GUI</h3>
<p>A ReactJS (ECMAScript 6+) based app that drives the API from the browser. The GUI is simply for convenience. It is a wrapper around the API that allows us to interact with the software from an easy to use and intuitive interface. <a href="/pages/gui.html">Learn more…</a></p>

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p>I aimed to write this code to be as platform independent as possible. However,
this does not run on Windows. Currently the code must be developed on a Debian
based version of Linux. The code can be expanded to run on Mac OS X if the
Mac is upgraded to run bash version 4 or greater. The code base also requires
small changes to detect whether or not use <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get</code> to install packages
locally. However, I do not have plans to implement this feature as it will not
provide much benefit nor functionality to the end product.</p>
